1. Dockerfile: It contains the instructions to build a Docker image by sepecifying the base image, dependencies, and run command.
2. Docker Image: A lightweight, standalone package that includes everything(code, libraries, and dependencies) needed to run your application. Images are built from a Dockerfile and can be versioned.
3. Docker Container: A running instance of a Docker image. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, providing a secure and reproducible environment for running your apps.
4. Docker Registry: A centralized repository for storing and distributing Docker images. For example, Docker Hub is the default public registry but you can also set up private registries.
5. Docker Compose: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications, making it easy to manage the entire stack.
6. Docker Networks: Used to enable communication between containers and the host system. Custom networks can isolate containers or enable selective communication.
7. Docker CLI: The primary way to interact with Docker, providing commands for building images, running containers, managing volumes, and performing other operations.
